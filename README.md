## About

This project contains a very simple agent running on e.g. a Raspberry Pi that collects
humidity data from a [Tinkerforge](https://www.tinkerforge.com/) sensor. It publishes data via MQTT.

Additionally, there is a [Smashing](https://github.com/Smashing/smashing) dashboard which visiualizes this data.

The `app.json` can be used to install the dasboard on a [Portal](https://getportal.org).

I described the setup in more detail in a [post on Medium](https://medium.com/@hudelmaier/publishing-iot-data-to-my-portal-28c5160d42fa)
